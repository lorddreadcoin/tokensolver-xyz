**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Authors:** TokenSOLver √ó $ABS Protocol Team  

## Abstract

The TokenSOLver Security Verification Standard (TSV-1) defines a comprehensive framework for evaluating the security and legitimacy of Solana-based tokens. This specification establishes 12 critical security rules, a weighted scoring system, and on-chain attestation mechanisms to protect users from malicious tokens and rug pulls.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

TSV-1 addresses the critical need for standardized token security verification in the Solana ecosystem. By implementing automated off-chain analysis combined with on-chain attestations, TSV-1 provides:

- **Standardized Security Assessment**: Consistent evaluation criteria across all tokens
- **Transparent Scoring**: Public, auditable security scores and grades
- **Launchpad Integration**: Gated token launches requiring minimum security standards
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance for security violations

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers:
- Security rule definitions and validation logic
- Scoring algorithms and grade classifications
- On-chain attestation protocol
- Oracle network requirements
- Launchpad integration standards

## 2. Security Rules

TSV-1 defines 12 security rules (R1-R12) that evaluate different aspects of token security:

### R1: Mint Authority Control
**Weight:** 20 (Critical)  
**Description:** Mint authority must be either null or controlled by a multisig wallet.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Mint authority is null OR mint authority is a known multisig program
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Mint authority is a single wallet address

**Rationale:** Prevents unlimited token minting that could dilute holder value.

### R2: Freeze Authority Control
**Weight:** 15 (High)  
**Description:** Freeze authority must be either null or controlled by a multisig wallet.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Freeze authority is null OR freeze authority is a known multisig program
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Freeze authority is a single wallet address

**Rationale:** Prevents arbitrary freezing of user token accounts.

### R3: Metadata Validation
**Weight:** 10 (Medium)  
**Description:** Token must have complete, valid metadata.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Name, symbol, and URI are present and valid
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Missing or invalid metadata fields

**Rationale:** Ensures token legitimacy and prevents impersonation.

### R4: Supply Cap Reasonableness
**Weight:** 8 (Medium)  
**Description:** Total supply must be within reasonable bounds.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Supply ‚â§ 1,000,000,000,000 tokens
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Supply > 1,000,000,000,000 tokens

**Rationale:** Prevents tokens with excessive supply that could indicate scam behavior.

### R5: Pool Verification
**Weight:** 12 (High)  
**Description:** Token must have a verified, active liquidity pool.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Active pool found on major DEX (Raydium, Orca, etc.)
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: No active pool or pool on unverified DEX

**Rationale:** Ensures token has legitimate trading infrastructure.

### R6: LP Time-Lock
**Weight:** 18 (Critical)  
**Description:** LP tokens must be time-locked for minimum 30 days.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: LP tokens locked for ‚â• 30 days
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: LP tokens not locked or locked for < 30 days

**Rationale:** Prevents rug pulls through immediate liquidity removal.

### R7: Pool Depth Adequacy
**Weight:** 5 (Low)  
**Description:** Pool must have sufficient liquidity depth.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Pool liquidity ‚â• $10,000 USD equivalent
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Pool liquidity < $10,000 USD equivalent

**Rationale:** Ensures meaningful trading liquidity exists.

### R8: No LP Mint After Lock
**Weight:** 15 (High)  
**Description:** No new LP tokens should be minted after initial lock.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: No LP minting events after lock timestamp
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: LP minting detected after lock

**Rationale:** Prevents dilution of locked LP through additional minting.

### R9: Top Holder Threshold
**Weight:** 8 (Medium)  
**Description:** Top 10 holders should not control excessive token supply.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Top 10 holders control < 70% of supply
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Top 10 holders control ‚â• 70% of supply

**Rationale:** Ensures reasonable token distribution.

### R10: Whale Risk Assessment
**Weight:** 6 (Medium)  
**Description:** Major holders should not exhibit high-risk behavior patterns.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: No high-risk wallets among top 20 holders
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: High-risk wallets detected in top holders

**Rationale:** Identifies potentially malicious large holders.

### R11: Program Log Analysis
**Weight:** 4 (Low)  
**Description:** Recent program interactions should not show anomalous patterns.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: No suspicious program log patterns detected
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Anomalous program behavior identified

**Rationale:** Detects potential smart contract exploits or unusual behavior.

### R12: Router Behavior Analysis
**Weight:** 3 (Low)  
**Description:** DEX router interactions should follow normal patterns.

**Validation Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Normal router interaction patterns
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Suspicious router behavior detected

**Rationale:** Identifies potential MEV attacks or routing manipulation.

## 3. Scoring System

### 3.1 Score Calculation

The overall security score is calculated using weighted rule results:

```
Score = Œ£(Rule_Weight √ó Rule_Result) / Œ£(Rule_Weight)
```

Where:
- `Rule_Result` = 1.0 for PASS, 0.0 for FAIL
- Total possible weight = 124

### 3.2 Grade Classification

Scores are converted to letter grades:

| Grade | Score Range | Description | Launchpad Eligibility |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| üü¢ **GREEN** | 0.85 - 1.00 | Excellent security | ‚úÖ Approved |
| üü° **YELLOW** | 0.70 - 0.84 | Good security | ‚úÖ Approved |
| üî¥ **RED** | 0.00 - 0.69 | Poor security | ‚ùå Rejected |

### 3.3 Critical Rule Override

Failure of critical rules (R1, R6) with weight ‚â• 15 automatically results in RED grade regardless of overall score.

## 4. On-Chain Attestation Protocol

### 4.1 Program Architecture

The SOLGuard Registry is an Anchor program that manages:
- **Config Account**: Global configuration and oracle management
- **Oracle Accounts**: Authorized attestation providers
- **Attestation Accounts**: Token security attestations

### 4.2 Attestation Process

1. **Off-chain Analysis**: Oracle performs TSV-1 rule validation
2. **Score Calculation**: Weighted score and grade determination
3. **Proof Generation**: Cryptographic hash of analysis results
4. **On-chain Submission**: Attestation stored with proof hash
5. **Verification**: Launchpad validates attestation before token approval

### 4.3 Account Structure

#### Config Account
```rust
pub struct Config {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub min_grade: u8,
    pub ruleset_version: u16,
    pub oracle_count: u32,
}
```

#### Oracle Account
```rust
pub struct Oracle {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub is_active: bool,
    pub attestation_count: u64,
    pub last_attestation: i64,
}
```

#### Attestation Account
```rust
pub struct Attestation {
    pub mint: Pubkey,
    pub oracle: Pubkey,
    pub ruleset_version: u16,
    pub score_bps: u16,
    pub grade: u8,
    pub proof_hash: [u8; 32],
    pub attested_at: i64,
    pub revoked: bool,
}
```

## 5. Oracle Network

### 5.1 Oracle Requirements

Authorized oracles must:
- Maintain high uptime (>99%)
- Use verified data sources (QuickNode, Helius)
- Implement proper error handling
- Provide audit trails

### 5.2 Data Sources

Primary data sources for rule validation:
- **Solana RPC**: On-chain account data
- **Helius API**: Token metadata and holder analysis
- **QuickNode**: Transaction history and program logs
- **DEX APIs**: Pool data and liquidity metrics

### 5.3 Attestation Frequency

- **New Tokens**: Immediate attestation upon detection
- **Existing Tokens**: Re-attestation every 7 days
- **Triggered Re-attestation**: On significant events (large transfers, pool changes)

## 6. Launchpad Integration

### 6.1 Gating Requirements

Token launches require:
- Valid TSV-1 attestation
- Minimum YELLOW grade
- Current ruleset version
- Non-revoked status

### 6.2 API Endpoints

#### Check Token Eligibility
```http
POST /api/launch/check/:mint
```

#### Submit Token Launch
```http
POST /api/launch/submit
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "mint": "string",
  "launcher": "string",
  "metadata": {...},
  "launch_config": {...},
  "fee_payment_signature": "string"
}
```

### 6.3 Launch Fees

- **Standard Fee**: 0.1 SOL
- **Treasury Wallet**: Multi-sig controlled
